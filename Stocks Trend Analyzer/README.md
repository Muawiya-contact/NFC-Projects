## 📘 Project Overview

**Stocks Trend Analyzer** is a Python-based application that analyzes historical stock market data using **Data Structures and Algorithms**.  
The system detects rising/falling patterns, computes moving averages, highlights buy–sell intervals, and visualizes trends using **Tkinter** and **Matplotlib**.

The goal is to help students understand how DSA concepts apply to real-world financial time-series data.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Financial datasets are large, noisy, and difficult for beginners to interpret. Without proper analysis, it becomes challenging to identify:

- Continuous rising or falling trends  
- Local highs and lows  
- Smoothed patterns (moving averages)  
- Optimal moments to buy or sell  

This project provides a simple and visual solution using efficient algorithms and Python-based tools.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a working desktop tool to analyze stock time-series data  
- Implement DSA concepts such as arrays, queues, stacks, and maps  
- Detect trends and compute moving averages  
- Identify the best buy–sell intervals using an O(n) algorithm  
- Visualize insights using charts  
- Create a user-friendly GUI for easy interaction

## 🧠 System Overview

| Component | Purpose |
|----------|----------|
| **Python (Core)** | Implements algorithms and data structures |
| **Tkinter** | GUI for importing and analyzing data |
| **Matplotlib** | Visualization of trends and signals |
| **CSV Dataset** | Yahoo Finance or Kaggle stock data |
| **DSA Used** | Arrays, Lists, Stacks, Queues, Maps |

---

## 🔬 Working Principle

1. User loads a CSV file containing daily stock prices.  
2. Data is stored in custom **Array/List** structures.  
3. Algorithms run on the dataset:  
   - Trend detection  
   - Moving average calculation (Queue / Sliding Window)  
   - Local high/low using Stack logic  
   - Max-profit interval (Buy–Sell Strategy)  
4. Tkinter displays results and summary.  
5. Matplotlib generates charts with lines, markers, and trends.
