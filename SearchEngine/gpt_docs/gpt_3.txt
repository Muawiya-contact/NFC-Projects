AI, or artificial intelligence, refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. AI technologies include machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. AI systems are designed to learn from data, adapt to new information, and make decisions or predictions based on patterns and algorithms.
